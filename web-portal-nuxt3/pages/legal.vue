    <h1>Legal</h1>

    <p class="statement">
      We care about your rights and your understanding of the legal framework of the services you use. So we are not hiding this information behind some out of the way link on our site. Here is a human-readable summary of the info in the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h4>Be a good human; don’t send us things that you don’t actually own.</h4>
    <p>We’re accepting of most definitions of <em>fair use</em>, but if the original copyright holders take issue with something you have published on our site, we have to take it down.</p>

    <h4>We strive to be good humans; we’ll NEVER reveal ANY personal information to a third-party.</h4>
    <p>That is simply not in our code. This project is open-source, so this statement is truly independently verifiable. We do share anonymized aggregated data with community leaders and businesses folks; like how many shows happened at a particular zip code and all the fun economic arguments for having Art, Theater and Music around, backed up by real data.
    </p>

    <h4>Please don’t spam us.</h4>
    <p>This is really reserved for blatant spammy stuff that is, alas, inevitable when one puts an open form up on the interwebs. But bear in mind, we’ll review the content you give us and we do reserve the right to take it down.
    </p>

    <h4>Please don’t scrape us.</h4>
    <p>As in write scripts that slurp up the data on the site. Be nice and we will give you stuff for free. Don’t slam our poor servers and increase our co$ts.
    </p>

    <h4>We ask for some rights to the things you give us, but we have really good reasons.</h4>
    <p> It’s mainly so we can promote your events everywhere; our web page, social media, printed materials, the works.
    </p>

    <h4>We do not "track" you with our cookies.</h4>
    <p>Cookies are bits of code that sit on your machine and remember the history of your site usage. We use our cookies to make your experience on our site easier and more intuitive. Like remembering your favorite setting; never spying on your activities.
    </p>

    <h4>We do use third-party software for analytics (specifically Google and Yandex) and these guys do track you... </h4>
    <p>We need them right now to get aggregated, anonymized user data. For example, we can see how many visitors we get per week, but we do not know your name or what you order at Starbucks. Or if you’ve abandoned Starbucks to go local. Aggregated data helps us when we apply for grants (we are a non-profit after all), and helps us set realistic goals for growing the site. The bits of code that these folks represent are basically on every website you visit these days. If you categorically have issues with them, we recommend using <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger" target="_new">Privacy Badger</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_new">Ghostery</a>, or something similar.
    </p>

    <h4>We wrote a few custom scripts for similar analytical purposes.</h4>
    <p>These give us info on specific UI elements, like the "add to calendar" feature. This basically helps us to confirm that a specific feature is important, or if you think it’s garbage and we should abandon it for the site’s next iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s about it. The stuff below is pure legalese. Feel free to <nuxt-link class="contact-link" to="/contact">reach out</nuxt-link> to us if you have any additional questions.

    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>Infinite Industries is committed to protecting your privacy. If you have provided us with your email address or other Personally Identifiable Information, we will hold that information in the strictest confidence. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. If you have questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at info@infinite.industries</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>We use "cookies" to recognize your browser and taylor some experiences to your specific site use history. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are used for convenience and are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Many web browsers allow you to block cookies.</p>

    <h4>What kind of data we collect</h4>
    <p>We collect and share with the third-parties data on events only. There is no Personally Identifiable Information passed through this process. Some of the data is shared via custom generated reports and some via API access granted to developers. </p>

    <h4>Analytics</h4>

    <p>We use Google Analytics and Yandex Metrika, which are web analytics services offered by Google and Yandex corporations respectively that tracks and report website traffic. Google and Yandex use the data collected to track and monitor the use of our website. This data is shared with other Google and Yandex services. Google and Yandex may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads for their own advertising network.</p>

    <p>We also use Yandex and custom scripts to look at how our interface is used by our audience. All the information collected this way is anonymized. In other words, we can tell that a certain feature is popular or not with our users but we have no idea whom specifically it is popular with. This allows us to make informed decisions on how we want to change our user interface and which new features to prioritize in development. </p>

    <p>Since our software is open-source, our usage of analytics software is completely transparent and independently verifiable. </p>
