     "description":"<p>Performance artist, playwright, and fashion designer Stephen Varble (b. Owensboro, Kentucky, 1946; d. New York City, 1984) was a fixture on the streets of SoHo in the 1970s, but his ephemeral practice has largely gone unrecognized in histories of art. His guerrilla practice aimed at disruption — of commerce, of gender roles, and of the institutions of art and celebrity. In elaborate sculptural garments made of street trash, Varble held unauthorized gallery tours through SoHo and protest performances in banks, Fifth Avenue stores, and in the street. A favourite of photographers such as Greg Day, Peter Hujar, and Jimmy DeSana, Varble’s art performed gender transformation and hybridity for both popular and art audiences in the 1970s. Over the past five years, David Getsy has been recovering, through interviews and private archives, the story of Varble’s work from his early performances as a student at the University of Kentucky to his participation in Fluxus and Warhol’s Factory to his unique brand of street performance to his work in video art. He will discuss Varble’s work and the struggle to write the first history of this performance artist who left little behind and who was antagonistic to art’s institutions.</p><p><br></p><p>David Getsy is the Goldabelle McComb Finn Distinguished Professor of Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His books include Abstract Bodies: Sixties Sculpture in the Expanded Field of Gender (2015); Scott Burton: Collected Writings on Art and Performance, 1965-1975 (2012); Rodin: Sex and the Making of Modern Sculpture (2010); and, most recently, the collection of artists’ writings, Queer, for the Whitechapel Gallery’s ‘Documents of Contemporary Art’ book series (2016). His current major projects focus on archival-based recoveries of queer and genderqueer performance art in the 1970s.</p>",

    "description": "Join us as we salute the musicians of the Commonwealth in celebration of Oxford American Magazine’s 2017 Kentucky music issue. The evening will feature an eclectic lineup of Kentucky musicians and performers spanning genres from bluegrass to blues rock and everything in between. Each act will perform a handful of songs, paying tribute to the musical trailblazers that paved the way for Kentucky’s rich musical heritage.<br /><br />Featured artists for the evening are:<br /><br />Joan Shelley | http://www.joanshelley.net <br />Based out of Louisville, Kentucky, singer/songwriter Joan Shelley's warm and mellifluous voice evokes both the deep south and west coast, drawing from both old-time country and '60s folk. A talented songwriter and prolific performer, Shelley splits her time between solo outings and collaborations with other area musicians like Daniel Martin Moore and Joe Manning, with whom she issued the albums Farthest Field (2012) and Outside Stay Outside (2014), respectively, and with the old-timey music trio Maiden Radio, which also features the talents of Julia Purcell and Cheyenne Mize. Shelley released her solo debut Ginko in 2012, followed by the No Quarter-issued Electric Ursa in 2014, the latter of which saw her working alongside fleet-fingered guitarist Nathan Salsburg. 2015's Over and Even found Shelley and Salsburg delivering an evocative set of country-folk originals that flirted with English and Irish traditional music. For her eponymous fifth studio LP, Shelley, Salsburg, and James Elkington headed up to Chicago to record with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy behind the board.<br /><br />The Wooks | http://www.wookoutamerica.com<br />Energetically honoring the sound of traditional bluegrass and mountain music, with threads of singer-songwriter, rock and jam band music woven throughout, The Wooks are as at home on a festival stage as they are in a barn in the heart of Kentucky's horse country. The Wooks are CJ Cain (guitar), Galen Green (mandolin), Arthur Hancock (banjo), Roddy Puckett (bass) and Jesse Wells (fiddle). Inspired by legends and trailblazers like Crowe, Whitley, Simpson, Bush, Stapleton and Rice who cut their teeth on stages throughout the bluegrass region, The Wooks translate the sights and sounds of the people, hills, bars, roads and creeks around them into songs and shows that captivate. With both respect for their heritage and innovative originality, The Wooks are the natural evolution of a sound that has always been there.<br /><br />Jecorey “1200” Arthur | http://1200llc.com<br />1200’s performances are known for being uncategorizable, featuring something everyone will love. Whether performing as a DJ, full band or piano soloist, no genre is off the table. Jecorey \"1200\" Arthur is an award-winning educator, composer, performer and curator from Louisville, Kentucky. His performances range from Forecastle Festival to the 92nd Street Y Musical Introduction Series, to collaborations with the Louisville Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony and Pittsburgh Symphony. Arthur dedicates his work to community as an event curator for City Collaborative, Speed Art Museum, Louisville Downtown Partnership and many more organizations. He is currently the music specialist at Hite Elementary where he teaches general music and directs performance ensembles. Through his 1200 performances, he is breaking down barriers in music education both on and off stage.<br /><br />Tee Dee Young | http://www.teedeeyoung.com<br />Tee Dee Young, a blues legend in his own time, definitely has the blues and loves “firing down on that guitar.” While playing his own unique style of the blues, his dynamic stage presence, exciting harmony and energy will put you in the mood for dancing. Young’s playing and singing are authentic to the genre but oblivious to current industry trends. His guitar is a weapon, wielded with total authority, assailing the listener with his sheer virtuosity. He writes and performs his own music, while covering music written by other artists. A native of Lexington, Kentucky, Young has been performing and playing for audiences for years and has opened up for and performed with legendary and acclaimed blues and R&B musicians such as Johnny Rawls, Guitar Shorty, Big Bill Morganfield, Albert King, Lil “Howling ” Wolf, Sir “Mack” Rice, Eddie Floyd, Malina Moye, Al Green, Denise LaSalle, Aretha Franklin, Cameo, Lakeside, James Brown, Alexander O’Neal, Vesta Williams, Miki Howard and many others. <br /><br />Brett Ratliff | http://brettratliff.net<br />Brett Ratliff's home place is Van Lear, Kentucky, the historic coal camp that gave birth to Loretta Lynn. Having been mentored by the masters of the area—George Gibson, Rich Kirby, Paul David Smith, Lee Sexton, and Jamie Wells among them—Ratliff is often the traditionally trained musician on stage with country, acid honk-a-tonk and cow punk. He has toured the region and the world with groups such as Clack Mountain String Band, Dirk Powell Band, Giant Rooster Sideshow and Rich & the Po’ Folk, and has played alongside the likes of Woody Pines, Chris Stapleton, Foghorn Stringband, Jean Ritchie, Mike Seeger and Art Stamper. Today Ratliff teaches traditional Kentucky repertoire at The Festival of American Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, Washington, Swannanoa Gathering in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Sore Fingers Week in Oxfordshire, England, Augusta Heritage's Early Country Music Week in Elkins, West Virginia, Cowan Creek Mountain Music School in Letcher County, Kentucky and elsewhere.<br /><br /><br />Johnny Conqueroo | http://www.johnnyconqueroo.com<br />Johnny Conqueroo is a highly kinetic blues/psych-rock trio from Lexington, Kentucky. Members include Grant Curless (guitar, vocals, keys), Wils Quinn (drums, vocals, percussion), and Shawn Reynolds (bass, keys). The band is touring in support of their second release, the new LP “Washed Up.\" After releasing their first EP in 2015, the band’s raw sound and energy drew the attention of local and regional audiences, with selection to play several 2016 festivals such as Moonshiners Ball, Beaux Arts Ball, Great Day, Moontower and Patchwork. As word spread, and EPs changed hands, eventually even Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Billy Gibbons took notice. Building on the momentum and grassroots support, Johnny Conqueroo released their genre bending LP “Washed Up” in December 2016, and is currently touring in support of “Washed Up”.",

The screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers moderated by Niles Center director emeritus, Ron Pen.<br /><br />An immersive meditation on the passage of time and the persistent resonance of place, Linefork follows the daily rituals of an elderly couple living in Kentucky's Appalachian Mountains. Now well into his eighties, Lee Sexton is the last living link to the distant past of a regional American music. A retired coal miner with black lung, Lee and his wife, Opal, continue to farm the land where he was born. Together they face encroaching health concerns and stark economic realities. Recorded over three years, Linefork is an observational film documenting their marriage, their community, their resilience, and the raw yet delicate music of an unheralded banjo legend, linked to the past yet immediately present.",

But now that it is, we are so grateful that we chose to close it with The Straight Story.</p><p>The last three minutes of screen time are all Harry's, and they are some of the most moving moments of his entire career. David Lynch has heralded this as his favorite collaboration with Harry, and we tend to agree. And when the camera tilts up to the stars at the end of the movie...we'll be sitting under them. </p><p>The evening will kick off at 7 pm with the debut of Lexington's newest mural--Harry's beautiful face on the side of the Kentucky Fun Mall as designed and produced by Graham Allen and Geoff Murphy of SQUAREPEGS Design. There will be a food truck (Minton's at 760!) and beer booth (Rock House Brewing!) and the movie will begin at dusk. Please join us for this outdoor event as we commemorate an unparalleled career and a fellow Kentuckian's life well lived.</p><p>Bryan Avenue will be closed for this event. Please bring lawn chairs or other seating implements.</p><p>Many thanks to our friends at Kentucky For Kentucky for making this free event possible.

    "description":"<p>Please join us for the opening reception of Howard Finster: Prophecy on plywood.</p><p>Howard Finster produced over 46,000 works over the course of his lifetime,but his cutouts make up the bulk of his output. Cheap and reasonably weather resistant, plywood offered a flat surface that could endure the seasons, especially when covered in oil-based tractor enamel. When asked about the use of this particular paint, Finster declared it 'the best paint in the world.' He had painted his tractor with it and after years of heat and humidity, it'still look good.'</p><p>Howard Finster's artistic career developed alongside his activities as a preacher and work as a builder and handyman. His first combinations of words and images, called 'chalk work', came in the form of blackboard diagrams that he made while teaching Sunday school. Essential to Finster's visual language is his intermixing of biblical references and American pop culture. Henry Ford,Albert Einstein, Elvis Presley and other iconic celebrities are represented for their accomplishments that are 'biblical' in scale, appearing with archangels, dinosaurs, Siamese Twins, and Coca-Cola bottles. Finster saw the existence of these men and objects as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.</p><p>This exhibition was made possible in part thanks to a grant from Visit LEX.</p>",
