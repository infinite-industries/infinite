But now that it is, we are so grateful that we chose to close it with The Straight Story.</p><p>The last three minutes of screen time are all Harry's, and they are some of the most moving moments of his entire career. David Lynch has heralded this as his favorite collaboration with Harry, and we tend to agree. And when the camera tilts up to the stars at the end of the movie...we'll be sitting under them. </p><p>The evening will kick off at 7 pm with the debut of Lexington's newest mural--Harry's beautiful face on the side of the Kentucky Fun Mall as designed and produced by Graham Allen and Geoff Murphy of SQUAREPEGS Design. There will be a food truck (Minton's at 760!) and beer booth (Rock House Brewing!) and the movie will begin at dusk. Please join us for this outdoor event as we commemorate an unparalleled career and a fellow Kentuckian's life well lived.</p><p>Bryan Avenue will be closed for this event. Please bring lawn chairs or other seating implements.</p><p>Many thanks to our friends at Kentucky For Kentucky for making this free event possible.

    "description":"<p>Please join us for the opening reception of Howard Finster: Prophecy on plywood.</p><p>Howard Finster produced over 46,000 works over the course of his lifetime,but his cutouts make up the bulk of his output. Cheap and reasonably weather resistant, plywood offered a flat surface that could endure the seasons, especially when covered in oil-based tractor enamel. When asked about the use of this particular paint, Finster declared it 'the best paint in the world.' He had painted his tractor with it and after years of heat and humidity, it'still look good.'</p><p>Howard Finster's artistic career developed alongside his activities as a preacher and work as a builder and handyman. His first combinations of words and images, called 'chalk work', came in the form of blackboard diagrams that he made while teaching Sunday school. Essential to Finster's visual language is his intermixing of biblical references and American pop culture. Henry Ford,Albert Einstein, Elvis Presley and other iconic celebrities are represented for their accomplishments that are 'biblical' in scale, appearing with archangels, dinosaurs, Siamese Twins, and Coca-Cola bottles. Finster saw the existence of these men and objects as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.</p><p>This exhibition was made possible in part thanks to a grant from Visit LEX.</p>",
