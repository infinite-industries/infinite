    "description":"<p>When we programmed this year's Harry Dean Stanton Fest, the last thing we wanted to imagine was that this year's event might be a memorial. But now that it is, we are so grateful that we chose to close it with The Straight Story.</p><p>The last three minutes of screen time are all Harry's, and they are some of the most moving moments of his entire career. David Lynch has heralded this as his favorite collaboration with Harry, and we tend to agree. And when the camera tilts up to the stars at the end of the movie...we'll be sitting under them. </p><p>The evening will kick off at 7 pm with the debut of Lexington's newest mural--Harry's beautiful face on the side of the Kentucky Fun Mall as designed and produced by Graham Allen and Geoff Murphy of SQUAREPEGS Design. There will be a food truck (Minton's at 760!) and beer booth (Rock House Brewing!) and the movie will begin at dusk. Please join us for this outdoor event as we commemorate an unparalleled career and a fellow Kentuckian's life well lived.</p><p>Bryan Avenue will be closed for this event. Please bring lawn chairs or other seating implements.</p><p>Many thanks to our friends at Kentucky For Kentucky for making this free event possible. Additional thanks to our other sponsors: Equus/Standardbred Station, Inc., 21c Museum Hotel Lexington, The Green Lantern Bar, CD Central, and The Bar Complex.</p><p>For full information on other Harry Dean Stanton Fest events, please visit: www.harrydeanstantonfest.org</p><p>",

At the end of this project, we hope participants will recognize more of the ways in which we are alike, instead of focusing on the biases and stereotypes that divide our community.</p><p>*Photos brought to the opening reception will be copied and returned to theirs owners.</p><p>Brought to you by CartCoop, a collection of individuals living and working in the East/North End of Lexington. The goal of the cooperative is to learn from established community activists and promote community engagement through creative endeavors.
