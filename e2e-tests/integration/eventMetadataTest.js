// proposal:
// this suite should
// (1) set up an event similar to the way eventEditingTest does
// (2) load up the single-event page (/events/:id) and make assertions
// and its primary mission should be to ensure the metadata in the head
// (title and description, Open Graph, JSON-LD) is correct
// given that we have broken parts of this in the past, this could be
// medium-to-high value
