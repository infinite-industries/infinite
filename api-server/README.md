## API Design Philosophy and Best Practices

* While database models use snake for fields the API should generally use camel case.
* Exceptions have been made for this where the data directly represents a database entity.
  * This is not ideal, we should not directly expose database model definitions via the api, but shortcuts
    have been taken.
* Endpoints should be as self descriptive as possible. You should be able to read the url and have a good idea what
  the endpoint does.
* Endpoints that requires authentication should be grouped into .authenticated controllers to make them stand out, see
  for example, the events.authenticated.controller.
