"<p><em>Longyear Lecture, Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHY MAKE MUSIC WITH NATURE?</strong></p><p><strong>David Rothenberg</strong>&nbsp;has long been interested in the musicality of sounds made by inhabitants of the animal world. He has jammed live with lyrebirds, broadcast his clarinet underwater for humpback whales, and covered himself in thirteen-year cicadas to wail away inside a wash of white noise.</p><p>Rothenberg presents a musical trajectory through several of his favorite species, revealing their distinct and evolved aesthetic senses in an attempt to show that music can reach across species lines, from human to animal, and back. Creatures whose musical worlds we will enter include the thrush nightingale, humpback whale, three-humped treehopper, snowy tree cricket, seventeen-year cicada, white-crested laughing thrush, superb lyrebird, European marsh warbler, lesser water boatman and the mountain pine bark beetle.</p><hr><p>Bio: </p><p>Musician and philosopher&nbsp;<strong>David Rothenberg</strong>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;Why Birds Sing&nbsp;(Basic Books and Penguin UK), also published in Italy, Spain, Taiwan, China, Korea, and Germany.

He explores our collective of mutating stories, challenging the sense of lack that drives so many to pack up and start over again. Chae's materials echo these cycles: the wooden frames supporting each artwork are recycled from a previous body of work; patchwork canvases are printed with cyanotype, yielding vague and hazy maps and landscapes in rich, fluid blue. Chae merges historic maps, East Asian brush paintings, Western oil paintings, and photos of wooden masks. Mutations abound, and chaos is organized into an uncanny equilibrium. </p>","{gallery,art}","[""gallery"",""art-exhibition"",""opening-reception"",""cyanotype"",""mixed-media"",""history"",""maps"",""masks"",""east-asian"",""western"",""homecoming""]"

"<p><strong>Join us for Dorian Hairston and Katerina Stoykova discussing and signing&nbsp;<em>Pretend the Ball is Named Jim Crow: The Story of Josh Gibson</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Between a Bird Cage and a Bird House</em>. Optional RSVP is below, but not required to attend the event.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Pretend the Ball Is Named Jim Crow: The Story of Josh Gibson</em>&nbsp;by Dorian Hairston</strong></p><p>Joshua ""Josh"" Gibson (1911–1947) is a baseball legend―one of the greatest power hitters in the Negro Leagues, and in all of baseball history. At the height of his career, this trailblazing athlete suffered grueling physical ailments, lost his young wife who died giving birth to their twins, and endured years of Jim Crow–era segregation and discrimination―all the while breaking records on the ball field.</p><p>Dorian Hairston's debut poetry collection explores the Black American experience through the lens of Gibson's life and seventeen-year baseball career, which culminated in his posthumous election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. Hairston brilliantly reconstructs the personas of Gibson and others in his orbit whose encounters with white supremacy interweave with the inevitability of losing loved ones. By alternating between the perspectives of Gibson, members of his family, and contemporary Black baseball players, Hairston captures the complexity and the pain of living under the oppressive weight of grief and racial discrimination.</p><p>Emotive, prescient, and absorbing, these powerful poems address social change, culture, family, race, death, and oppression―while honoring and giving voice to Gibson and a voiceless generation of African Americans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dorian Hairston</strong>&nbsp;is a poet, scholar, and former University of Kentucky baseball player from Lexington, Kentucky. He is a member of the Affrilachian Poets and his work has appeared in&nbsp;<em>Shale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Anthology of Appalachian Writers</em>, and&nbsp;<em>pluck!</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Between a Bird Cage and a Bird House: Poems</em>&nbsp;by Katerina Stoykova</strong></p><p>The fall of the Iron Curtain in the early 1990s ushered in a new tide of European immigrants to the United States. These populations, which hailed primarily from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, were largely adrift in America's cultural melting pot. Laden with their belongings and informed by their experiences, these immigrants became citizens of a new diaspora searching for space to exist in their adopted home.</p><p>In Between a Bird Cage and a Bird House, author Katerina Stoykova follows that which ""calls / the roaming mind / looking for land"" with the shell of her homeland at her back. Through themes of domestic abuse, the death of a parent, the loss of a friend, and the search for cultural identity, the poems in this collection transcend the borders of language and nation-states. As a Bulgarian immigrant, Stoykova weighs the differences between safety and captivity, exploring how one can feel sheltered yet still not feel at home.</p><p>Through a series of addresses to her new domestic partner, America, the speaker in this collection expresses gratitude while simultaneously interrogating the landscape that has come to ""home"" her. With every line of verse, Stoykova's unique grasp on the turns of the English language brings a fresh perspective to immigrant identity and lays bare the terrifying and thrilling duality of living between two cultures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Katerina Stoykova</strong>&nbsp;is an author, editor, teacher, and translator from Bulgaria. She immigrated to the United States in 1995, publishing several poetry books in English and Bulgarian since her arrival. Her book&nbsp;<em>Second Skin</em>&nbsp;was awarded a grant from the European Commission to be translated and published in English. In 2010 she launched an independent literary press, Accents Publishing.</p>",{literary arts},"[""literary-arts"",""talk"",""music"",""film"",""gallery"",""dance"",""theater"",""comedy"",""festival""]"

"<p>&nbsp;As an avid hiker and naturalist, Gary’s muse was always close at hand.The places where he ventured, the forests, fields, mountains and streams provided an endless bounty of subject matter. From those first drawings at age 4, to the rediscovery of himself as an artist these many years later, the mastery of Gary’s craft has blossomed. He captures a certain essence of place. With color, line, mood and shadow, each creation is both universal and unique. Each work is a visual tale that we all recognize, but also something very personal that only the artist has shared, alone in nature, during those sweet moments of peace. As Gary so eloquently puts it, “I hope you can sense the beauty of the silence that these places speak.”</p>","{gallery,art}","[""art"",""nature"",""painting"",""gallery""]"

Thanks to his direct, non-patronizing and, most importantly, kind delivery, Burton became a conduit to learning for children of every background - delving behind the pages to the people, places, and things each new story explored.</p><p>Q&amp;A with executive producer and consulting editor Dava Whisenant immediately following screening (87 minute run time).</p><p><em>Southern Circuit screenings are funded in part by a grant from South Arts, a regional arts organization, in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts.

"<p>For 20 years, Carter Stanley helped lay the foundation of bluegrass music as one half of the <em>Stanley Brothers Old-time Mountain Music Show</em>. Carter's passion was playing music and enjoying the musician's way of life – the lights, the stage, the song, the applause, the adoration, the camaraderie, and the drink; the drink that stole the passion. Gone from the music scene for nearly 50 years, his legacy has largely been forgotten with the passage of time. Until now.</p><p>Join actor, musician, and writer Gary Reid as he becomes Carter Stanley in this dramatic theatrical production of Stanley's life. A storyteller, 40-year bluegrass veteran, and the foremost authority on the Stanley Brothers, Gary affords today's bluegrass and old-time music fans a chance to reminisce through his performance.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer(s)</strong>: Programs and events are photographed or videotaped for library promotional purposes, including social media.&nbsp;If you prefer not to be photographed or recorded, please notify library staff.</p>",{theater},"[""music"",""theater"",""bluegrass"",""old-time"",""biography"",""drama""]"

"<p><strong>The Steel Woods</strong> have captivated audiences with their powerful sound and heartfelt lyrics since their formation in 2016. Co-founded by Wes Bayliss and Jason Cope, the band has amassed over 200 million streams in their short lifespan. Their songs ""Axe,"" ""Blind Lover,"" and ""Out of The Blue"" have been featured on Taylor Sheridan's hit TV shows <em>Yellowstone</em> and <em>Tulsa King</em>. Road warriors at heart, The Steel Woods have had toured rigorously, building a loyal fan base brick by brick, while sharing the stage with the likes of Blackberry Smoke, Cody Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Cody Jinks, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Dwight Yoakam, to name a few. Tragedy struck in 2021 when founder and creative visionary, Jason Cope, passed away due to complications from diabetes. The band pressed on, continuing to tour, and released their final studio album, <em>On Your Time</em>, in the Fall of 2023. With four studio records behind them, Wes Bayliss shared the news to their fans in March of 2024 that The Steel Woods will stop touring at the end of the year, putting an end to ""one of the most promising new outfits in independent roots music.""</p><p>w/ Aaron Raitiere</p><p>Outdoor show</p><p>Rain or shine</p><p>All-ages</p><p>Doors 6:30 PM | Show 8:00 PM</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">With a transcendent vocal, down-to-earth storytelling, and a Heaven-sent desire to glorify Jesus, Anne Wilson is one of Nashville’s most inspiring young trailblazers – a Lexington, Ky. native mixing the heart of Contemporary Christian Music, and the sound of Country. Finding her musical mission in the wake of tragedy, Wilson delivered her first public performance at 15 while singing “What a Beautiful Name” at her brother’s funeral in a moving expression of faith that soon went viral. Called at that moment to continue, her 2021 debut single, “My Jesus,” marked the arrival of a new star, fusing personal conviction with upbeat roots energy to become a GOLD-certified No.1 on Billboard’s Christian Airplay chart. The track made Wilson the first debut female solo artist in chart history to reach No.1 and went on to be named ASCAP’s 2022 Christian Music Awards Song of the Year. Now boasting more than 435M global career streams, her rise is gaining momentum.</span></p>","{christian music,live music}","[""music"",""christian"",""country"",""contemporary-christian"",""inspirational"",""faith"",""tragedy"",""debut"",""rising-star""]"

"<p>The work of Texan artist Sam Linguist hovers in this windy landscape of threatening weather and charming local eccentricity. In fact, his ceramic paintings look windblown. Like something archaeologically found, the images on the surfaces are a random cohort of both abstract and representational things. The backs of the paintings are not excluded from the artist’s mark. Linguist often scrawls out the name of the work there as well as his own signature, perhaps embracing the random gift of having a name meaning ‘adept at language.’</p><p>Lately, Linguist has deployed a series of crudely-welded metal armatures – reminiscent of antiquated moon towers used to light public spaces from the late 19th century into the mid-20th – to hold some of his paintings at jutting angles away from the wall, allowing people to see the backstamp and titles. One feels an imminent sense of danger and responsibility around these fragile pieces, which precariously dangle on small metal pegs at the end of the skeletal structures.</p><p><br></p>","{art,gallery,reception,opening}","[""gallery"",""ceramics"",""sculpture"",""installation"",""mixed-media"",""contemporary-art""]"

"<p>The work of Texan artist Sam Linguist hovers in this windy landscape of threatening weather and charming local eccentricity. In fact, his ceramic paintings look windblown. Like something archaeologically found, the images on the surfaces are a random cohort of both abstract and representational things. The backs of the paintings are not excluded from the artist’s mark. Linguist often scrawls out the name of the work there as well as his own signature, perhaps embracing the random gift of having a name meaning ‘adept at language.’</p><p>Lately, Linguist has deployed a series of crudely-welded metal armatures – reminiscent of antiquated moon towers used to light public spaces from the late 19th century into the mid-20th – to hold some of his paintings at jutting angles away from the wall, allowing people to see the backstamp and titles. One feels an imminent sense of danger and responsibility around these fragile pieces, which precariously dangle on small metal pegs at the end of the skeletal structures.</p><p><br></p>","{gallery,art}","[""gallery"",""ceramics"",""sculpture"",""installation"",""abstract"",""representational"",""outsider-art"",""texas-artist""]"
"<p>More than one hundred years after his birth, Federico Fellini still stands apart as a giant of the cinema. The Italian maestro is defined by his dualities: the sacred and the profane, the masculine and the feminine, the provincial and the urbane. He began his career working in the slice-of-life poetry of neorealism, and though he soon spun off on his own freewheeling creative axis, he never lost that grounding, evoking his dreams, memories, and obsessions in increasingly grand productions teeming with carnivalesque imagery and flights of phantasmagoric surrealism while maintaining an earthy, embodied connection to humanity. </p><p>The Kentucky Theatre is proud to screen four of Fellini’s most celebrated and seminal films as a tribute to an artist who conjured a cinematic universe all his own: a vision of the world as a three-ring circus in which his innermost infatuations, fears, and fantasies take center stage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Q&amp;A with Raymond De Luca, an assistant professor and specialist in international film studies at the University of Kentucky</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>""One of the greatest films about film ever made.""</strong>&nbsp;—<em>Criterion</em></p><p><strong>""An exciting, stimulating, monumental creation.""</strong><em>&nbsp;—Variety</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>""A carnival of the soul.""</strong>&nbsp;—<em>Little White Lies</em>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s&nbsp;<em>8½</em>&nbsp;marks the moment when the director’s always-personal approach to filmmaking fully embraced self-reflexivity, pioneering a stream-of-consciousness style that darts exuberantly among flashbacks, dream sequences, and carnivalesque reality, and turning one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema.

He began his career working in the slice-of-life poetry of neorealism, and though he soon spun off on his own freewheeling creative axis, he never lost that grounding, evoking his dreams, memories, and obsessions in increasingly grand productions teeming with carnivalesque imagery and flights of phantasmagoric surrealism while maintaining an earthy, embodied connection to humanity. </p><p>The Kentucky Theatre is proud to screen four of Fellini’s most celebrated and seminal films as a tribute to an artist who conjured a cinematic universe all his own: a vision of the world as a three-ring circus in which his innermost infatuations, fears, and fantasies take center stage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Q&amp;A with Raymond De Luca, an assistant professor and specialist in international film studies at the University of Kentucky</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>""One of the director’s best-loved creations.""&nbsp;</strong>—<em>Criterion</em></p><p><strong>""This veers from the heartfelt to the satirical, the scathing to the loving, the funny to the melancholy — in short, it's everything that great cinema should be.""</strong>&nbsp;—<em>Empire Magazine</em></p><p><strong>""[Fellini] leaves us with the hope that the human comedy just may be able to survive everything.""</strong>&nbsp;—<em>Los Angeles Times</em></p><p>Federico Fellini returned to the provincial landscape of his childhood with this carnivalesque reminiscence, recreating his hometown of Rimini in Cinecittà’s studios and rendering its daily life as a circus of social rituals, adolescent desires, male fantasies, and political subterfuge. Sketching a gallery of warmly observed comic caricatures, Fellini affectionately evokes a vanished world haloed with the glow of memory, even as he sends up authority figures representing church and state, satirizing a country stultified by Fascism. Winner of Fellini’s fourth Academy Award for best foreign-language film,&nbsp;<em>Amarcord&nbsp;</em>remains one of the director’s best-loved creations, beautifully weaving together Giuseppe Rottuno’s colorful cinematography, Danilo Donati’s extravagant costumes and sets, and Nino Rota’s nostalgia-tinged score.</p>",{film},"[""film"",""comedy"",""italian"",""nostalgia"",""circus"",""satire"",""memory"",""surrealism"",""fellini"",""1970s""]"
"<p>Firmly situated in this nexus of the incredible and the banal are the paintings of Megan Bickel. Layers upon layers of paint, digital prints, cement, natural landscapes, pencil, cutting-edge textiles, photographic representations, and virtual reality experiments combine to produce a depth so extensive it begins to appear irremediably flat. It’s hard to escape the thought that with just a bit closer of a look, just a bit longer tracing the marks on the canvas, you’ll break through to the truth buried under the artifice. But that resolution is constantly interrupted.  </p>","{art,gallery,opening}","[""gallery"",""painting"",""contemporary-art"",""mixed-media"",""experimental"",""virtual-reality""]"

Tickets are $5 for adults and free for students. Tickets will be sold at the door.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em><span class=""ql-cursor"">﻿﻿</span></em></strong>Online Q&amp;A with protagonist George Anthony Morton following screening (84 minute run time)</p><p>Master of Light is a portrait of George Anthony Morton, a renowned classical painter, who spent a decade in federal prison for drug charges. While he was incarcerated, George turned to painting as a means of survival and a tool for healing. In the years since his release, George is doing everything he can to defy society’s unlevel playing field and tackle the white-dominant art world, including graduating from the prestigious Florence Academy of Art and opening his own studio, Atelier South, in Atlanta. Master of Light is an inspirational story of resilience and immense talent emerging in the face of the oppressive circumstances of prison, and a powerful lens into breaking intergenerational cycles of trauma that fuel mass incarceration. Master of Light is a film by Rosa Ruth Boesten and George Anthony Morton, directed by Rosa Ruth Boesten, and produced by Roger Ross Williams, Anousha Nzume, and Ilja Roomans. Master of Light has won numerous awards, including the Grand Jury Award for Documentary Feature at the 2022 SXSW Film Festival. Master of Light premiered on HBO and HBO Max on November 16.</p>","{film,screening}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>Dieter Roth was a German-Swiss Conceptual artist known for his use of non-traditional materials in making sculptures and installations. Cheese, sausage, and chocolate, among other items, would lend definite odors (not always pleasant ones) during the run of his exhibitions. Roth enjoyed blurring the line between process and product, and his work often questioned assumptions about permanence.</p><p><br></p><p>His practice included drawing, printmaking, books, audio, and multi-media presentations. Roth moved easily between these modes, and he often collaborated with like-minded peers, including Richard Hamilton, Hermann Nitsch, Arnulf Rainer, and Emmett Williams. In the later years of his life, he worked extensively with his son, Björn Roth.</p><p><br></p><p>The prints in this exhibition are from two Roth portfolios,&nbsp;</p><p><em>2 Times 5 Bats&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2 Times 5 Trophies</em>, printed as offset lithographs with additional drawings by the artist in graphite. These images show photographic images of sculptural forms (bats and trophies), either solidly balanced or teetering at the edge of possible collapse.</p>",{gallery},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>This exhibition brings together the trompe l’œil sculptures of two established artists who transform clay and plywood into tableaus of everyday items including clothing, branches, envelopes, and bowls of fruit. Their works are likely to be familiar to Lexington audiences, but Isaacs and Shay are being shown together here for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Their mastery of craft contributes to a sense of wonder, as they individually take realism to a place where magic seems to reside. Combining techniques of carving and constructing, firing and glazing, their works draw viewers in for intimate experiences of questioning and contemplation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ron Isaacs has said, “I am still fascinated by the old, simple idea of resemblance, the very first idea of art after tools and shelter: that an object made of one material can take on the outward appearance and therefore some of the ‘reality’ of another.” His precise constructions are hard to believe, as billowing vintage fabrics, leather gloves, and various leaves reveal themselves to be all made of painted wood.</p><p><br></p><p>Robert Shay’s ceramic works are often untitled, but they each offer unique combinations of scale and specificity. He explores the history of still life, combining the rough or elegant shapes of oranges, lemons, and limes, with matte and glossy exteriors. The bowls and platters are equally important, offering reflections of the fruit resting in or on them, as well as the approaching observer.</p>",{gallery},"[""sculpture"",""trompe-l'oeil"",""gallery"",""realism"",""ceramic"",""wood"",""still-life""]"

"<p>The <a href=""https://finearts.uky.edu/theatre-dance"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">UK Department of Theatre and Dance</a> presents its 13th Annual Dance Concert, <em>Home</em>.</p><p>Director of the dance program, Susie Thiel, created a new dance theatre work in collaboration with eight dance majors. The dance is presented in a series of short vignettes discussing women's rights and issues past to present. It is told from the perspective of the cast of women students, who range from ages 18 to 22 years old. This is a population that is often not provided with an opportunity to discuss their thoughts on women's issues in a public arena.&nbsp;What is unique about the dance is that the soundscape is created solely from the dancers on the stage, through instrument playing, speaking, and singing bodies. Connected to the concert title ""Home,"" the women performers feel that there is nothing closer to ""home"" than the belief that women rights ARE human rights.</p><p>Each year, the Department of Theatre and Dance brings in a guest artist to teach classes to our students and to set a dance work on the dancers. Chris and Ama Law, creators of <a href=""https://www.kennedy-center.org/artists/p/po-pz/-project-charma/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Project Charma</a>, set a hip-hop dance on five dance students. <em>Building the Beat</em> is inspired by Chris' favorite house dancer Mamson (based in France). This celebration allows the audience to witness community building, rhythmic play and the recurrence of circle as connection. The beats heard and the dance forms seen connect humans in a way where there is no choice but to look past differences and build community along with the beat.</p><p>The dancers worked extremely hard during a five-day residency to build the dance. Chris and Ama couldn't be prouder of the cast of five and all the ways they have supported and built each other up while pushing themselves past exhaustion to feel the purpose of our mission and the intricate connections to the music.</p><p><em>Glaciation</em>, created by sophomore student choreographer Ali King, investigates the repercussions of climate change both on the environment and humanity itself. From the rapid melting rate of glaciers to the deterioration of coral reefs, the future of our planet is at great risk. King's work implicates the audience's active role amid this climate crisis, and asks viewers: where do we go from here? With a sculptural quality, the dancers are immersed in a unique fusion of found sound and new music scores that conjure, inhabit, and impact these fragile environments.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Rince, Repeat</em>, faculty choreographer Laura Neese merges percussive and soft shoe Irish step dance traditions, and contemporary modern dance, to explore themes of rigidity and freedom, structure, and play, embedded in the vibrant cultural traditions of Irish dance and music. Tied to the concert theme,<em> Home</em>, Neese excavates cultural heritage and artistic lineage. As a longtime company member of Bessie-nominated Darrah Carr Dance, Neese honors Carr’s ModERIN fusion of Irish step and modern dance by sharing the dance, or rince, forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Theresa Bautista is a part-time instructor at the Department of Theatre &amp; Dance and the recipient of the FY21 Al Smith Fellowship Award in Choreography. Her new contemporary ballet, <em>Seeking</em>, blurs the language of classical ballet and contemporary forms to investigate fear in the face of uncertainty, diving into the unknown, and the implications of blindly moving forward.</p>","{dance,theater}","[""dance"",""theater"",""women's-rights"",""hip-hop"",""climate-change"",""contemporary"",""ballet"",""Irish-dance"",""music""]"

"<p><em>The Simon &amp; Garfunkel Story</em> is an immersive concert-style theater show that chronicles the amazing journey shared by the folk-rock duo, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. Using state of the art projection and original photos and film footage it tells the story of their humble beginnings, their success as one of the best-selling music groups of the '60s, and their dramatic split in 1970. It culminates with the famous ""The Concert in Central Park"" reunion in 1981 with more than half a million fans in attendance. This show is all about the music; Simon &amp; Garfunkel's signature harmonies and songs that poignantly captured the times make for an evening of wonderful music and nostalgia.</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>In a string of visionary films that challenged the audience’s perceptions of time and space, Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky created a cinematic language all his own, one in which weighty philosophical themes found expression in images of haunting, spectral beauty. Ranging from the transcendent medieval drama <strong><em>Andrei Rublev</em></strong> to meditative sci-fi epics like <strong><em>Solaris</em></strong> and <strong><em>Stalker</em></strong>, his enormously influential masterpieces are consistent in their astonishing ambition and profound insights into spirituality and metaphysical experience.</p><p>For the first time ever, The Kentucky Theatre is screening seven of Tarkovksy’s most iconic cinematic works, from Wednesday, November 11 through Wednesday, December 6. Each screening will include a <strong>Q&amp;A by Raymond De Luca</strong>, Assistant Professor of Russian Studies and International Film Studies at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>This is a very rare opportunity to see so many works by a filmmaker without equal.</p><p><strong>Tickets go on sale very soon.</strong></p>",{film},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>In this talk, Geoff and Sharisse McCafferty highlight how the ancient peoples of central Mexico envisioned themselves and their ‘mythstories’ through their art, as well as their relationship with the sacred landscape.</p><p><br></p><p>Art has the ability to transcend language. The Indigenous Ancestors of Mexico understood this and painted their ‘mythstories’ in vibrant pictorial manuscripts, or codices, that could be read’ by anyone with a basic understanding of the themes. In contrast to Maya hieroglyphic texts, codices in the Borgia and Mixtec traditions from central Mexico were mostly figural, depicting mortals and supernaturals with minimal glyphic notations. In addition to ritual and genealogical information, they provide a rich presentation of the material culture, ranging from costume to architecture, and including the natural environment.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This event is presented in conjunction with Israel Campos’ current exhibition at 2nd Story, <a href=""https://www.2ndstory.art/current-exhibitions-israelcampos"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>Cleansing of the Sentinels</em></a>. In his artistic practice, Campos draws influence from Mesoamerican codices, in combination with stylistic elements from contemporary Chicano culture.</p><p><br></p><p>Geoff and Sharisse McCafferty are Adjunct Professors in the Department of Anthropology of the University of Kentucky. For five decades they have studied the archaeology and visual culture of Mexico and Central America, with particular focus on social identities such as gender and ethnicity.</p>","{gallery,talk}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>This exhibition is the first examination of the various collaborative works that poet/author/critic John Yau has created with a range of visual artists during the past five decades. These include paintings, mixed media works on paper, print portfolios, artist books, and letterpress broadsides. As he says, ""I'm into every way a poem can be done.""</p><p>Yau's poetry is infused with humor and intelligence, and he uses a variety of forms to examine aspects of his Chinese-American identity, visual art and film, detective novels, and popular culture. His reviews and essays are celebrated for providing fresh insights into canonical artists and for helping to situate diverse practitioners into historical contexts and traditions.</p><p>The result of friendships and shared sensibilities, Yau's collaborations reveal his embrace of both representation and abstraction as foils for language generation. Offering nimble turns of phrase, Zen koans, road sign warnings, and fragmented and completed poems, he has been a curious and generous partner in producing these unique works with established and emerging artists including:</p><p>Phil Allen, Bill Barrette, Jake Berthot, Norman Bluhm, Tom Burckhardt, Squeak Carnwath, Aaron Cohick, Tracy Featherstone, Enrique Figueredo, Pia Fries, Max Gimblett, Richard Hull, Bill Jensen, Justine Kurland, Judy Ledgerwood, Suzanne McClelland, Malcom Morley, Ilse Sorensen Murdock, Martin Noel, Ed Paschke, Norbet Prangenberg, Archie Rand, Sydney Jean Reisen, Peter Saul, Hanns Schimansky, Pat Steir, Siv Stoldal, and Carol Szymanski, Alison Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Terrien, Richard Tuttle, Claude Viallat, Chuck Webster, and Trevor Winkfield, among others.</p><p>Yau has collaborated alongside artists in their studios or at printmaking facilities, as well as through more remote means - providing words, lines, and finished texts for use in variously produced and published endeavors.&nbsp;<em>Disguise the Limit</em>&nbsp;presents these works on gallery walls and in vitrines, offering rich word/image combinations that are the result of serious play and the masterful use of materials and printing/binding techniques.</p><p>John Yau has authored numerous books of poetry and prose including&nbsp;<em>Corpse and Mirror&nbsp;</em>(1983);&nbsp;<em>Edificio Sayonara</em>&nbsp;(1992);&nbsp;<em>Hawaiian Cowboys</em>&nbsp;(1995);&nbsp;<em>Forbidden Entries</em>&nbsp;(1996);&nbsp;<em>Borrowed Love Poems</em>&nbsp;(2022);&nbsp;<em>Ing Grish</em>&nbsp;(2005);&nbsp;<em>Paradiso Diaspora</em>&nbsp;(2006);&nbsp;<em>Further Adventures in Monochrome</em>&nbsp;(2012);&nbsp;<em>Bijoux in the Dark&nbsp;</em>(2018);&nbsp;<em>Genghis Chan on Drums</em>&nbsp;(2021); and&nbsp;<em>Tell It Slant&nbsp;</em>(2023).</p><p>His critical writings and monographs include I<em>n the Realm of Appearances; The Art of Andy Warhol</em>&nbsp;(1993);&nbsp;<em>The Passionate Spectator: Essays on Art and Poetry</em>&nbsp;(2006);&nbsp;<em>A Thing Among Things: The Art of Jasper Johns</em>&nbsp;(2008);&nbsp;<em>Catherine Murphy</em>&nbsp;(2016);&nbsp;<em>The Wild Children of William Blake</em>&nbsp;(2017);&nbsp;<em>Thomas Nozkowski&nbsp;</em>(2017);&nbsp;<em>Foreign Sounds or Sounds Foreign</em>&nbsp;(2020);&nbsp;<em>Liu Xiadong</em>&nbsp;(2021);&nbsp;<em>Joe Brainard: The Art of the Personal</em>&nbsp;(2022); and&nbsp;<em>Please Wait by the Coatroom: Reconsidering Race and Identity in American Art</em>&nbsp;(2023).</p><p>This exhibition is made possible by a generous grant from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.terraamericanart.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 51, 160);""><strong>Terra Foundation for American Art,</strong></a>&nbsp;with additional support from the Albisetti Exhibition Fund.

"<p>Walid Raad is a Lebanon-born and New York-based artist whose work investigates the ways that history is remembered and represented. He makes use of archives and photographs in the public realm and questions aspects of veracity and meaning in the context of ongoing wars in the Middle East. Raad is well-known for The Atlas Group (1989-2004), a fifteen-year project which borrows from the genres of literary fiction and conceptual photography.&nbsp;</p><p>In this exhibition, the artist presents works from three distinct series, each combining text with found or made photographs. Works from&nbsp;<em>Sweet Talk: Commissions (Beirut)&nbsp;</em>consist of streetscapes of the city found in a book, annotated with hand-written inscriptions in English and Arabic. The black-and-white images are brought to life by the language, which includes statements like, ""In 1976 or 1977, and around the corner from this building, a militiaman teaches me how to fire a rifle, launch a grenade, and graffiti anti-Palestinian slogans. I remember him laughing the whole time.""</p><p><em>Festival of Gratitude</em>&nbsp;documents a fantasy the artist claims to have had while working as a teenage photographer in a pastry shop in Beirut. Should he poison the birthday and celebration cakes he understood as being made to celebrate adored and/or despised world leaders?</p><p><em>The Bleeding Stomach</em>&nbsp;offers the story of Chef Ramza, Lebanon's most beloved chef and cookbook author. Known to be an avowed pacifist, she traveled all over the country hosting lavish dinners for fighting militias in the hope that their common foods might unite them. But just in case this optimism failed, she flavored her dishes with various hallucinogens to reset their brains.</p><p>How are violence and trauma normalized? How does one navigate profound anxiety and sadness while attempting to maintain hope? Raad consistently finds intelligent and empathetic ways of posing such questions, and in light of the horrific recent events taking place in Israel and Gaza, his exhibition could not be more relevant.</p><p>Walid Raad has had one-person exhibitions at the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His work is in the collections of the Walker Art Center, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Centre Pompidou, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>In association with the exhibition, Raad will discuss his work on February 16 as one of the 2024 speakers in the Robert C. May Photography Lecture Series.</p>",{art},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

Kris unleashes&nbsp;waves of good will with Macy's customers and the commercial world of New York City by referring parents to other&nbsp;stores to find exactly the toy their child has asked for. Seen as deluded and dangerous by Macy's vocational&nbsp;counselor, who plots to have Kris shanghaied to Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, Kris ends up in a court competency&nbsp;hearing. Especially at stake is one little girl's belief in Santa. In a dramatic decision, the court confirms Kris as the&nbsp;true Santa, allowing Susan and countless other children to experience the joy of childhood fantasy.</p>","{theater,holiday}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

Most bands only get one shot at the brass ring, and once the opportunity passes by, it's gone forever. Maybe that's why Uncle Lucius sounds like a band reborn on Like It's The Last One Left, a cathartic comeback album that reunites the platinum-selling group — and pumps new blood into its roster — after a five-year hiatus. Written and recorded in the band's hometown of Austin, Texas, Like It's The Last One Left isn't just a return to form; it's an expansion, bolstering Uncle Lucius' mix of amped-up Americana and greasy roots-rock with string arrangements, adventurous production, and the sharpest songwriting of the group's career.</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>The 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Drama winner FAIRVIEW follows the Fraiser family as they prepare for their grandmother's perfect birthday. But as the perfect party becomes increasingly difficult to pull off, is anything as it seems? This dazzling play, part comedy, part searing satire, is full of surprises. The Pulitzer Committee called FAIRVIEW ""a hard-hitting drama that examines race in a highly conceptual, layered structure, ultimately bringing audiences into the actors' community to face deep-seated prejudices.""</p>","{theater,comedy}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

Limestone, this Friday, June 21, 2024 at 7pm. Marking the summer solstice, the party will include live performances, all-ages art activities, light refreshments, art, and creative vendors. Suggested donation is $5-$35, and attendees are encouraged to “dress to express”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(41, 56, 73);"">Expression is at the heart of what Levee aspires to do. “We want people to feel inspired toward whatever it is they need to live a more authentic, whole, and artistic life,” says Tosha Sun, one of the founders of the collective. “While our focus day-to-day is on BIPOC women and femmes and their unique needs for respite and healing, the zine and launch party offer a chance for us and our members to engage artistically with the broader community.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(41, 56, 73);"">Levee events are often for members only and include yoga, high teas, creative respite rituals, dance, writing sessions, kids’ yoga and art classes, and more. While much of what the collective engages in is experience-based, the zine is an artifact, a quarterly, full-color offering that features local poetry, 2-D art, fashion, seasonal recipes, healing rituals, occasional gardening notes, astrological guidance, and more.</span></p>","{zine,art,fashion}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p><span style=""color: rgb(82, 82, 82);"">This ongoing subversive archival project re-examines the history of modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s design for the Illinois Institute of Technology’s postwar campus expansion, which led to the strategic erasure of a primarily Black neighborhood in Chicago’s South Side. Conceived as an archival apparatus, the installation deconstructs the official campus history and complicates the architect’s legacy, which rarely diverges from a discussion about form and architectural ideology, by inviting visitors to peek into the material record that was necessarily suppressed to create the myth of a tabula rasa created by an architect intent on creating an “apolitical” architecture in the name of progress.</span></p>","{gallery,architecture}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

Hailed as “part Stax, part Motown and part honky-tonk” by The New York Times, Hicks’ intoxicating blend of soul, blues, country, and rock 'n' roll quickly rendered him a household name as he progressed to the show’s record-breaking finale in 2006, a historic television event which drew an audience of more than 200 million viewers. Hicks immediately followed his ""American Idol"" victory with a No. 1 Billboard single and an RIAA®-certified platinum debut, and soon went on to make history as both the first male ""American Idol"" champion featured on a GRAMMY-winning record (Jimmy Fallon’s Blow Your Pants Off), and the first to land a prestigious Las Vegas residency. A versatile artist, actor and advocate, Hicks has since ventured into theater, television and film, starring in Serenbe Playhouse's 2019 production of ""Shenandoah,"" touring as Teen Angel in the popular Broadway musical “Grease” in addition to appearing on “Law &amp; Order: SVU” and hosting the INSP series “State Plate,” which won the Cynopsis TV Award for Best Reality Series (Travel). Hicks’ passion for southern cuisine led him back to his native Alabama, where he opened up SAW's Juke Joint, a restaurant crowned one of the “25 Best Barbecue Spots in America” by Men’s Journal.</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p><span style=""color: rgb(61, 62, 62);"">Join us on Saturday, March 2 at 1pm for a special artist talk &amp; portrait session with Rudy Salgado of River City Tintype Photography Studio! Rudy will show historical wet-plate collodion images from his collection, and share his experience and portfolio, as a 21st century wet-plate artist. Collodion photography was invented in 1851 and swiftly became popular for Americans as portraits and tourist images throughout the 19th century. Rudy pairs his passion for history with contemporary portraiture as a working artist. Like 19th-century tintype photographers, he will bring a mobile darkroom and make photographic plates on site after his presentation. You can sign up to get your very own portrait done on Saturday between 2pm-7pm here:&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://bookrivercitytintype.as.me/schedule.php"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(6, 119, 214); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">https://bookrivercitytintype.as.me/schedule.php</a></p>","{photo,artist talk}","ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p>Colin Stetson is a bold, singular force in contemporary music. His recorded output, not to mention studio and live collaborations – with, among others, Lou Reed, Tom Waits, LCD Soundsystem, The National, Chemical Brothers, Bon Iver and Bill Laswell – has proven as prolific as it is praiseworthy. Since the 21st century's early years Stetson has gained a well-deserved reputation as an exceptional musician, his devotion to craft consummate, his commitment to innovation indisputable. Known for assertive, powerhouse performances on the saxophone – chiefly bass and alto, but also soprano, tenor and baritone – Stetson employs extended techniques and intense dynamic volumes to maximum effect. He's similarly at home, though, whatever the musical context, on clarinet, flute, French Horn and cornet. One might even say he operates in a field all his own.</p><p>Stetson's 2007 breakthrough album, <em>New History Warfare Vol. 1</em>, coincided with his drafting by Arcade Fire, with whom he'd play until 2010. That year he moved to Montreal to join his future (but now ex-) wife, the band's Sarah Neufeld, with whom he recorded the fervid and beautiful album, <em>Never Were The Way She Was</em> (2015), and the following year he released ""Sorrow,"" an extraordinary reimagining of Gorecki's legendary Symphony of Sorrow. In-between he completed the <em>New History Warfare</em> trilogy, a virtuosic illustration of the ""world-building,"" as he calls it, that's critical to much of his solo work, while 2017's <em>All This I Do for Glory</em> consolidated his reputation, earning multiple nominations for critics' Album of the Year lists.</p><p>Stetson's nature is defiantly single-minded, and his dogged focus is always evident; his swooping, circling and soaring motifs display as much sensitivity as strength. This is something to which his striking – and diverse – contributions to film, TV and game scores also powerfully attest, including, most recently, 2018's<em> Hereditary</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, 2021's <em>Among The Stars</em>, and 2022's <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> and <em>The Menu</em>. As distinguished BBC broadcaster Mary Anne Hobbs once observed, Colin Stetson is ""an artist that can change the way you actually think about music.""</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p><a href=""https://finearts.uky.edu/singletary-center"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Singletary Center for the Arts</a> presents a co-headlining performance by two of the South's finest songwriters, Louisville's Joan Shelley and Durham, NC's Jake Xerxes Fussell.</p><p>Joan&nbsp;Shelley is a songwriter and singer who lives near Louisville, Ky., not far from where she grew up. She draws inspiration from traditional and traditionally-minded performers from her native Kentucky, as well as those from Ireland, Scotland, and England, but she's not a folksinger. Her disposition aligns more closely with that of, say, Roger Miller, Dolly Parton, or her fellow Kentuckian Tom T. Hall, who once explained—simply, succinctly, in a song—""I Witness Life.""</p><p>Since the 2015 release of her album <em>Over and Even</em>, Shelley has crossed the country and toured Europe several times as a headlining artist, typically with guitarist Nathan Salsburg, and sharing shows with the likes of Jake Xerxes Fussell, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, The Other Years, and Michael Hurley. She has opened for Wilco, Chris Smither, Patty Griffin, Andrew Bird and Richard Thompson and has appeared as a guest on <em>WTF with Marc Maron</em>, <em>Fresh Air</em> and <em>Later… with Jools Holland</em>.</p><p>Singer, guitarist, and folk music interpreter Jake Xerxes Fussell has distinguished himself as one of his generation's preeminent interpreters of traditional (and not so traditional) ""folk"" songs, a practice which he approaches with a refreshingly unfussy lack of nostalgia. By recontextualizing ancient vernacular songs and sources of the American South, he allows them to breathe and speak for themselves and for himself; he alternately inhabits them and allows them to inhabit him. In all his work, Fussell humanizes his material with his own curatorial and interpretive gifts, unmooring stories and melodies from their specific eras and origins and setting them adrift in our own waterways.</p><p>Fussell's newest album, <em>Good and Green Again</em> was released Jan 21, 2022 via Paradise of Bachelors. Produced by James Elkington, the record navigates fresh sonic and compositional landscapes and is, perhaps, his most conceptually focused to-date.&nbsp;He has toured with the Decembrists, Wilco, the Magnetic Fields, Joan Shelley, and Bill Callahan and was an artist-in-residence for the 2023 Big Ears Music Festival.</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [

"<p><strong>Sundy Best</strong> is an American country duo formed by Nick Jamerson and Kris Bentley from Prestonsburg, Kentucky. They are crowd rockers who are both prolific songwriters, offering a blend of country, Appalachian folk, bluegrass, rock, soul, and R&amp;B. Their Appalachian roots intertwine into the lyrics and melodies of every song they sing.</p><p>In 2013 CMT discovered Sundy Best and began playing their video ""Home."" Entertainment One signed the duo in 2013 and re-released <em>Door Without A Screen</em>, adding seven songs including new ones, as well as fan favorites from their shows. They have since released four albums.</p><p>The 23-year-old singer/songwriter <strong>Hannah Howard</strong>'s raw and impassioned songwriting was birthed from life in small-town Appalachia. From uplifting melodies to heart-rending ballads, Hannah writes and performs from a place of deep, intense emotion and awareness. Her talent brings a new spin on indie/ folk rock- claiming the title of ""ethereal folk.""</p><p>All ages | Ticket purchase is required for all attendees. 18 and under must be accompanied by an adult.

Hancock &amp; Shouse has also long been musical ambassadors for Can'd Aid, a Colorado based nonprofit that has donated over 3,000 instruments to classrooms nationwide since 2013.</p><p>As a result, Hancock &amp; Shouse have long been trailblazers both on and off the stage and show no signs of slowing down.</p>",{music},"ERROR: HttpException: Unable to get a valid response from third party tag provider: [
